# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

# Description 
This is a Work day scheduler that was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
This application can help people plan out their work days every hour throughout the day from 9AM to 5PM.

The top of the page shows the current day and shows the exact date
Within each time block a color will pop up if there is an event within the box and show whether it occurs in the past, present, or future. Gray indicates past, present indicates red, and future indicates green. 

Once a person enters the info inside of each time block and click the blue save button the text will be saved in the local storage and will still be shown even after the page is refreshed.
